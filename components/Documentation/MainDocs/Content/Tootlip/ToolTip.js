     <p>The tooltip, also known as nilotic or hint, is a common graphical user interface (GUI) element in which, when hovering over a screen element or component, a text box displays information about that element, such as a description of a button's function, what an abbreviation stands for, or the exact absolute time stamp over a relative time {("â€¦ ago")}. </p>

     <p className="mt-8"><span className="text-indigo-600">In common practice,</span> the tooltip is displayed continuously as long as the user hovers over the element or the text box provided by the tool.[1] It is sometimes possible for the mouse to hover within the text box provided to activate a nested tooltip, and this can continue to any depth, often with multiple text boxes overlapped.</p>
